    "Title": "David Krejci Retires From NHL",
    "Content": "Boston Bruins center David Krejci has announced his retirement from the NHL. The Czech forward wraps things up after spending 16 seasons in the league and becoming the ninth-highest scorer in Bruins history with 786 points (231 goals, 555 assists) in 1,032 regular-season games. Krejci, who won the Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011, already left the league in 2021 but returned for one more campaign in 2022-23, and he still looked good, putting up 56 points (16 goals, 40 assists) in 70 games. The 37-year-old might be done with the NHL, but hockey fans could still see him in high-level action next year, as it's been speculated that Krejci will be eager to suit up in the 2024 World Championship, which is hosted by his native Czech Republic. With Patrice Bergeron also retiring this offseason, the Bruins will look very different at the center position going forward.",
